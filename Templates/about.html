<h2> Hey there. this is my new website. </h2>

<p>This is a simple Word counter I have been playing around with and trying out new things.
 I started to learn coding during the Lockdown in the Uk all thanks to the coronavirus (aka Covid19).
 I wanted to learn coding so i can progress and achieve a better life for me and my future family.
 So i did this coures and hopefully i can achieve my dreams</p>
